The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making.  The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question.  Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required.

occupant comfort in commercial buildings that, in the US, are moving toward net zero energy and net zero carbon emissions   Active systems introduced in this class include:  Electric lighting  Mechanical ventilation  Active heating and cooling  Water systems for interior and exterior use and water heating, including solar  Onsite electricity generation with renewable energy  Building transportation systems  Active fire protection  smoke control  Because of the breadth of this subject area, the course will be futurefocused, concentrating on design approaches and technologies that appear to be wellsuited to a net zero energy and net zero carbon future.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null,

Fall 2019 Section A1: Germs: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly  Bacteria are a scourge to humankind, causing life-threating infections like tuberculosis, meningitis, and pneumonia to the less severe ear infections and strep throats that plague many childhoods. On the other hand, the healthy human microbiota is a community of microorganisms dominated by trillions of bacteria that reside everywhere from our skin to nasal passages and gut. This virtual organ is estimated to weigh as much as the human brain and contributes to essential bodily functions like food metabolism and defense against infection, while also impacting memory, anxiety, and depression. Changes in the gut microbiota are also associated with diseases including autism, obesity, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease. Why the incidence of these chronic diseases is increasing is unclear, but it may be the result of excessive antibiotic use, dietary changes that harm our gut microbes, or both. This century will be marked by both the challenge of antibiotic resistant infectious bad bacteria, and the possibilities to harness good bacteria to promote human health. In this course, we explore how bacteria make you healthy and what we can do to nurture our microbiota, and how bacteria make you sick and what we can do to stop them.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Germs The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", "units": 6.0, "department": "Biological Sciences", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "12:00PM", "end": "01:20PM", "building": "SH", "room": "219", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A1", "instructors": ["Mccartney, Brooke", "Hiller, Natalia"]}, {"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "begin": "03:00PM", "end": "04:20PM", "building": "SH", "room": "219", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A2", "instructors": ["Mitchell, Aaron"]}], "sections": []}, "03-117": {"desc": "In this hands-on laboratory class, students will investigate a current biology problem.

We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure. The material in this course will be interdisciplinary, drawn from the fields of math, computer science, physics, sociology, political science, and economics.

With recent developments in machine learning, we are reaching a point where we might not even have to explicit specify a new generative schema, but, instead, let it learn automatically from data or experience.

The emphasis will be on powder bed machines for printing metal parts, reflecting the research emphasis at CMU. The full scope of methods in use, however, will also be covered. The topics are intended to enable students to understand which materials are feasible for 3D printing. Accordingly, high power density welding methods such as electron beam and laser welding will be discussed, along with the characteristic defects. Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection.

This workshop builds upon a thesis that interactive games share a large portion of dramatic theory DNA with plays, TV, and film. Play is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player.  To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. Once we lay the groundwork, students are divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Teamsuse an existing pen-and-paper RPG system to create a set of a campaign-style story for that system and that story world. The final product is a hard copy story bible of portfolio-quality. I emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course.  Any level of writing experience is welcome, as I provide support and instruction to scaffold in experienced students.

These techniques combine ideas from program analysis, constraint solving, and model checking and have shown great promises in making software more reliable and secure. In this course, we will study these new techniques, with emphasis on automated test-case generation based on symbolic execution and fuzz testing. We will see how these techniques can be used for detecting bugs in software, finding performance bottlenecks, detecting and preventing security vulnerabilities, and analyzing the reliability of software components.

The instructors and project sponsors (customers) will guide the students in developing an understanding of the problem domain (environment and requirements) and selecting suitable technologies for addressing the challenges specific to it, creating and documenting a system architecture with verifiable interfaces, decomposing the architecture into sub-problems that sub-groups of students can address, integrating the results into a single system, and verifying system performance against the documented requirements. Consistent with the Wireless Systems concentration methodologies, student work will be organized around fixed-length sprints followed by an evaluation of progress with the customer and instructors.

Mastering both principles and relevant models is important for those who wish to seriously understand how todays electric power grids work and their challenging technical issues. This prepares students for working on applying many novel information processing concepts for designing and operating more reliable, secure, and efficient electric energy systems.

How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly.

Space appears as something that exists around us: our houses, our neighborhoods, our cities might seem like they are simply there to be moved through. In the same way mobility, from our means of transport to an evening walk, can appear as just movement from A to B. In the late 20th century, an interdisciplinary group that included geographers, urban studies scholars, architects, sociologists, anthropologists, and literary theorists began to theorize the social construction of space. They argued that space is something dynamically created that may be interpreted for the ways it creates meaning. Following this spatial turn, mobilities studies scholars looked to understand movement as something that reproduces and constitutes power and institutions. This interdisciplinary course considers theories of space and movement as a field of study and in reference to literary and film texts.

This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive.

Objectives: By the end of the course the student should be able to: Decide the suitability of applying design thinking in a given context Explain the design thinking process and its most common tools  Apply the design thinking process in the context of a service or software product definition", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Design Thinking", "units": 6.0, "department": "Heinz College Wide Courses", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "01:30PM", "end": "02:50PM", "building": "HBH", "room": "1005", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A1", "instructors": ["Zak, Timothy"]}, {"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "04:30PM", "end": "05:50PM", "building": "TOR", "room": "CLASS5", "location": "Adelaide, Australia"}], "name": "K1", "instructors": ["Austin, Stuart"]}, {"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "06:00PM", "end": "07:20PM", "building": "TOR", "room": "CLASS5", "location": "Adelaide, Australia"}], "name": "L2", "instructors": ["Austin, Stuart"]}], "sections": []}, "94-870": {"desc": "Data are everywhere.

Historically, radios were hardware-dependent and fixed to a specific signal waveform. Your modern smartphone implements several individual radios (2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, GPS, FM radio, Bluetooth, etc). A software-defined radio would adapt to these different waveforms and receive all of them with one radio. In this course, we will study the end-to-end processes involved in radio transmitters and receivers (or transceivers) such as modulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, amplification, etc. Using a physical device to implement the front-end of the receiver, we will design the other processes in software; for example, we can design an FM software-defined receiver to receive existing FM radio signals in Kigali. We will also visualize spectrum occupancy by developing a simple spectrum analyzer in software that covers from very low to GHz frequency range. Basic programming skills will be helpful.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Augmented and Virtual Reality", "units": null, "department": "Information & Communication Technology", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "begin": "08:30AM", "end": "10:20AM", "building": "CMR", "room": "C421", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "name": "E2", "instructors": ["Perkins, Michael"]}, {"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "12:20PM", "building": null, "room": null, "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "name": "G2", "instructors": ["Instructor TBA"]}, {"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "12:20PM", "building": "CMR", "room": "C425", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "name": "I2", "instructors": ["Instructor TBA"]}, {"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "12:20PM", "building": "CMR", "room": "C421", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "name": "L2", "instructors": ["Mugume, Edwin"]}], "sections": []}, "04-910": {"desc": "The Entrepreneurship Project class is an opportunity for students to build and practice skills in developing information technology ideas that create value for a selected set of customers.

Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions.  The key to such optimal decision-making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance.  The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models.  We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions.  These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition.

Enterprise web applications are a complex relationship between the client, server, and any additional back-end services.  Web systems are becoming more supportive of users such that the system must adapt based on the needs and behaviors of the users.  This course will support the understanding of the data that drives the enterprise web development, which includes the analysis of web traffic and usage, ads, and the personalization of the web experience.    This course focuses on the development of an enterprise web application with specific emphasis on the server-side enterprise web application programming and an n-tier system approach.  The students in teams will design and develop a full enterprise web application including an n-tier implementation over the lifetime of the course. The development aspect will include server programming languages and systems (such as PHP, Django, Node) and database support (such as mySQL) as well as appropriate front-end development.   Course evaluation will include weekly quizzes based on assigned readings, a cumulative final exam and a course project which is the enterprise web application that the students will build.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Enterprise Web Development", "units": 6.0, "department": "Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2], "begin": "06:00PM", "end": "08:50PM", "building": "HBH", "room": "2008", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A2", "instructors": ["Bigrigg, Michael"]}], "sections": []}, "95-881": {"desc": "With to the ability to capture everything the users do, web applications are at the front lines of data analytics.

Today, we have the ability to design human-computer systems in which both human and computers act intelligently, adapt to the world and learn from experience, improving their performance over time. How do we design such collaborative systems, taking advantage of the fundamentally different ways in which humans and computers act and learn? How do we build smart systems that achieve their intended goals, with a minimum of unintended side effects? This course will give students the opportunity to address such questions. After an introduction of some basic concepts and techniques in AI and data science (only a basic familiarity with statistics is assumed), the course illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications.

In the culture, which values and emphasizes conformity, the phenomenon is utterly unprecedented.  Accordingly, in this course, we will first explore the defining features of these anomalies  by examining how Japanese youth are portrayed in modern day fictions and films.  We will then scrutinize the extent to which these portrayals actually reflect real lives of young Japanese by analyzing newspaper articles and essays commenting on the social issues surrounding them.  Finally, we will take a close look at the dramatic social changes, over the past three decades, to trace their long-term impacts  as a significant factor contributing to the emergence of the new culture, particularly with respect to the changing youth behaviors.

This process teaches us to observe and experience how we approach our lives, both physically and mentally. The technique enables us to recognize and release patterns of tension by redirecting excessive effort into useful energy, resulting in improved balance, flexibility and co-ordination. We learn how to transform tension into attention, fatigue into kinesthetic lightness.

The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilberts Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. Gdels incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work.

The common view that mathematics - if not directly static, is evolving in a linear fashion - does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual changes concerning the very nature and object of mathematics.  We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect radical transformations of the subject. They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly.   The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilberts Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. Gdels incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work.

The nature of this apparent miracle changed dramatically over the course of the 1990s as the most advanced economy in the region, Japan, suffered a sharp growth slowdown, and a number of the other miracle economies were engulfed in a regional economic crisis in the latter half of the decade.

Despite these economic problems, accelerating growth in the worlds most populous countries, China and India, helped sustain regional progress and kept global attention focused on economic growth in Asia through the 2000s and 2010s, even though the growth and the international attention were largely concentrated in a different set of countries.

The course will apply some methodologies commonplace in industry like agile, design-thinking, and open source to deliver products and services that have the potential to live on beyond the course.  For public-facing projects, work will be done in a transparent manner where possible in order to encourage external participation.   Some examples of potential outcomes might include prototyping a service to match entrepreneurs with funding opportunities in government; a GIS-based web application to connect those looking for housing assistance programs with government services; or an economic impact analysis of a particular industry or sector.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Policy Innovation Lab", "units": 6.0, "department": "Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "01:30PM", "end": "02:50PM", "building": "HBH", "room": "1004", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A1", "instructors": ["Goranson, Christopher"]}], "sections": []}, "90-798": {"desc": "Environmental Policy and Planning provides an introduction to how environmental policies have been and can be designed/created implemented and evaluated amidst complex information-based social political and cultural processes.

This course provides an introduction to the most important items in an applied econometricians toolkit: (i) analysis of randomized controlled trials; (ii) regression models designed to control for variables that may mask the causal effects of interest; (iii) difference-in-differences-type strategies that use repeated observations to control for unobserved omitted factors; and (iv) instrumental variables and regression discontinuity methods for the analysis of real and natural experiments. In this course, emphasis will be given to conceptual issues and statistical techniques that turn up in the applied research we read and do. Many empirical examples will illustrate these ideas and techniques.  Within the Heinz College, 90-906 is appropriate for first-year PhD students plus first and second year Masters students who desire and are prepared for a rigorous course in econometrics as a base for more advanced research methodology.

This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e. students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course but do not have the background for the microeconomic sequence offered at GSIA; and (iii) M.S. students who have an especially strong background in mathematics. Notice that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper microeconomics sequence. Students who want to take more advanced microeconomics courses and who have the preparation are encouraged to investigate the courses offered at Tepper.  There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, students are assumed to have a solid working knowledge of multivariate calculus.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

SECTION AA: Foundations of Quantitative Program Analysis Resource usage---the amount of time, memory, and energy a program requires for its execution---is one of the central subjects of computer science. Nevertheless, resource usage often does not play a central role in classical programming-language concepts such as operational semantics, type systems, and program logics. This course revisits these concepts to model and analyze resource usage of programs in a formal and compositional way. The emphasis is on practical, type-based techniques that automatically inform programmers about the resource usage of their code. We also discuss applications of the techniques, in particular in programming languages for digital contracts.  The second part of the course studies probabilistic programming languages. Such languages describe probability distributions and can be used to precisely describe and analyze probabilistic models. The focus of the course is on semantics and analysis of probabilistic language but we also discuss applications of probabilistic programming.

Cars, aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms to control CPSs is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding. In this course we will strive to answer the fundamental question posed by Jeannette Wing:  How can we provide people with cyber-physical systems they can bet their lives on? Students who successfully complete this course will:  \t\t Understand the core principles behind CPSs. \t\t Develop models and controls. \t\t Identify safety specifications and critical properties of CPSs. \t\t Understand abstraction and system architectures. \t\t Learn how to design by invariant. \t\t Reason rigorously about CPS models and their differential equations. \t\t Verify CPS models of appropriate scale. \t\t Understand the semantics of a CPS model. \t\t Develop an intuition for operational effects. This course will give you the required skills to formally analyze the CPSs that are all around us -- from power plants to pace makers and everything in between -- so that when you contribute to the design of a CPS, you are able to understand important safety-critical aspects and feel confident designing and analyzing system models.

Description: In designing computer systems one is usually constrained by certain performance requirements and limitations. For example, one might need to guarantee a response time SLA or certain throughput requirement, while at the same time staying within a power budget or cost budget. On the other hand, one often has many choices: One fast disk, or two slow ones? More memory, or a faster processor? A fair scheduler or one that minimizes mean response time? For multi-server systems, one can choose from a wide array of load balancing policies, a wide array of migration policies, capacity provisioning schemes, power management policies ... The possibilities are endless. The best choices are often counter-intuitive. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions before investing the time and money to build a system. This class will introduce students to analytic stochastic modeling with the aim of answering the above questions.   This class is heavy on math.

COURSES BEGIN THE WK OF SEPT3rd CC: Description: With the growing number of massive datasets in applications such as machine learning and numerical linear algebra, classical algorithms for processing such datasets are often no longer feasible. In this course we will cover algorithmic techniques, models, and lower bounds for handling such data. A common theme is the use of randomized methods, such as sketching and sampling, to provide dimensionality reduction. In the context of optimization problems, this leads to faster algorithms, and we will see examples of this in the form of least squares regression and low rank approximation of matrices and tensors, as well as robust variants of these problems. In the context of distributed algorithms, dimensionality reduction leads to communication-efficient protocols, while in the context of data stream algorithms, it leads to memory-efficient algorithms. We will study some of the above problems in such models, such as low rank approximation, but also consider a variety of classical streaming problems such as counting distinct elements, finding frequent items, and estimating norms....FF: Description: The course will focus on faster exact algorithms for NP-hard problems. Since exact algorithms for these problems cannot run in polynomial time, one direction is to get faster (though still exponential-time) algorithms. Another direction is to study fixed-parameter algorithms, which consider the fine-grained complexity of the problem in terms not only of the instance size n, but also of other parameters of the input (e.g., the treewidth of the instance, or the value of the optimal solution).

Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.

This includes learning many types of tasks based on many types of experience, e.g. spotting high-risk medical patients, recognizing speech, classifying text documents, detecting credit card fraud, or driving autonomous vehicles. 10301 covers all or most of: concept learning, decision trees, neural networks, linear learning, active learning, estimation  the bias-variance tradeoff, hypothesis testing, Bayesian learning, the MDL principle, the Gibbs classifier, Naive Bayes, Bayes Nets  Graphical Models, the EM algorithm, Hidden Markov Models, K-Nearest-Neighbors and nonparametric learning, reinforcement learning, bagging, boosting and discriminative training. Grading will be based on weekly or biweekly assignments (written and/or programming), a midterm, a final exam. 10301 is recommended for undergraduates who are not SCS majors. (SCS majors should instead take 10315.) Prerequisites (strictly enforced): strong quantitative aptitude, college probability  statistics course, and programming proficiency.

This course explores the concepts of customer service and customer-driven within the context of service, e-commerce, and other companies.  It will examine what companies must do to attract, keep, and get repeat business from highly satisfied customers.  It will explore how traditional businesses accomplish these goals and whether traditional concepts/tools apply to e-commerce companies.  When possible, it will highlight traditional and e-commerce companies that provide positive and negative examples.    The course will also distinguish between e-commerce companies that provide a service and those that are customer-driven arms for manufacturing companies.  Even some manufacturing companies (e.g. autos and computers) that traditionally were production or technology driven now find competitive advantage in being customer-driven.  (Ford Motor changed its company slogan from Quality if 1 at Ford to The Customer is 1 at Ford.)  As these companies move into an e-commerce environment, it may require a re-thinking of their business and approach to customers.    Topics that may be included are:      What does it mean to be customer-driven for any business?      How do you (or should you) make your firm more customer-driven?      How does a customer-driven strategy change the way a company positions itse", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Customer-Driven Strategies and Services", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1], "begin": "06:30PM", "end": "10:00PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2112", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "E2", "instructors": ["Kelley, Robert"]}], "sections": []}, "45-923": {"desc": "The financial crisis has focused attention on the role of regulation for our financial system and the broader economy.

The basic premise of this course is that these technologies can be used to fulfill the goal of a customer-centered marketing strategy.  This course advocates an interactive marketing strategy as a framework for how to go about marketing to consumers with electronic tools. Interactive marketing evolves this strategy further by focusing not just on the companys interaction with the customer (e.g. advertising and direct communications) but the customers interaction with the company. This interaction has been enabled by electronic technology, such as the Internet, World Wide Web, E-mail, Instant Messaging, Search, and Social Media.

Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.  It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.  The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis.

If time permits polynomial time solvability of linear programs, extensions to conic optimization problems, conic duality, and an introduction to interior point methods are topics of interest in the given order.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Linear Programming", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "12:20PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "4219", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A1", "instructors": ["Kilinc-Karzan, Fatma"]}], "sections": []}, "47-835": {"desc": "This is the first part of a full-semester course on algorithmic graph theory.
